# Assignment2_task1-2

Task 1:

I have taken a input as an integer.
I have used if and else statement.
In if statment I have used modulo operator to find the remainder of a number if divided by 2.
If the remainder is 0 then it means it is divisible by 2. So, the number is even otherwise it is odd number.

Task 2:

I have taken a sum1 variable that I have assigned it to 0.
I have created a for loop and put range function in it.
for loop is running from 1 to 51 as last number in range function is excluded.
And then I am taking all the inputs and adding them in sum1 variable.
I then printed sum1.
